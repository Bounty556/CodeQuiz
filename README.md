# Code Quiz

## Description

The Code Quiz is a multiple-choice-question-only quiz that tests the user on various fields of their Javascript knowledge. The quiz is timed, giving the user 90 seconds at the start of the quiz to complete it. Every question answered incorrectly also removes 10 seconds from the timer. This timer simultaneously acts as the user's score - the quicker and more accurately the user completes the quiz, the higher their score.

Once the user has completed the quiz, or it has ended prematurely due to the time running out, the user is given the option to save their score to the leaderboard for the quiz under a 3-character tag. These scores are saved to the user's browser locally and can be cleared whenever the user desires. The leaderboard scores are sorted from highest to lowest score.
